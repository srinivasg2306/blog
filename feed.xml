Add to that, imagine if the organization is selling multiple brands - each one acting as a separate sub-company complete with its own set of business and IT Teams. Each brand has an army on Analysts - experts in spreadsheet reports. They are experts in pulling out data from ERP and other IT systems, combining and munching the data on their laptops and generating hundreds of spreadsheets for management review.
