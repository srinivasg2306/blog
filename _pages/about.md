I am a Data and Analytics Enthusiast. Although most part of my career was spent building Mainframe Applications, I discovered that my passion was really in Math, Stats, Data and Analytics. I just love progaming in Python, and try to stay in touch with latest in the field. I consider myself a student and blogging is one of the best way to learn and review concepts. So here I am!!
