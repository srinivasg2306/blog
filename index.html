<h2>Hello and Welcome to my Blog!</h2>

I have tried to put together all my learnings during the course of professional career in the fields of Data and Analytics. I am not an expert in the field, however, I have met several, and have researched a little bit. My intention is to provide pointers to useful articles, provide some tips, and provide a beginners perspective to different aspects of Data and Analytics. Personally, I am passionate about Data and Analytics, and a novice when it comes to blogging. So, you may not find flashy stuff here, and the blog site is WIP
But, I still hope you find the articles useful. Please share your feedback on my twitter feed
