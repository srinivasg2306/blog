    "### Concept of Vectors and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, A vector is represented by a single dimension array of numbers. Example: V = [25, 3, 46, 30, 33]. This makes no sense to a Machine Learning practitioner until it can be related to something real. Let us say the numbers represents certain data of an individual - Age, years of Work experience, Annual Salary(in 000 USD), Average Expenses per year (in 000 USD), % of Annual salary saved per year. If such data are collected for multiple individuals and stacked up one over the other, then we have an array of vectors which is called a *Matrix*. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a Linear Algebra perspective, a Matrix can represent one of the two:\n",
    "1. **Systems of Linear Equations** - Matrix operations can be used to represent a set of linear equations. This helps us solve the equations, define inverse of matrices.\n",
    "2. **Linear Mapping** - Matrices can be used to define Linear Mappings. Linear mapping define transformation actions that can be performed on Vectors.  Examples of Vector Transformations that fall into this bucket are: Rotation, Stretching along specific axes, change of basis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take an example of a Matrix that represents a set of Vectors - i.e . Data. Let us assume that the Data consists of rows - which represents users, and columns which represents products that they have purchased. So we have a user-product matrix.\n",
    "The matrix maps each user to each product. If a user Ui has purchased product Vj then the cell ij will contain the number of items purchased. If a user has never purchased a product, then the corresponding cell will have a 0. Please note that at this stage, we just have Sales Data arranged in a certain way (in the form of matrix). This does not give any additional information. ***So how do we break it down into chunks of comprehendable pieces? Enter Factorization!***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concept of Matrix Factorization\n",
    "Suppose you had a number - say 28, and you want to understand it better. What do you do? You can say 28 is 7 times 4, which is 7 times 2 times 2 (7 x 2 x 2). This tells us that 7 and 2 are latent in the number 28. What happens if we apply factorization to Matrices? By extending the logic, we must be able to understand the latent factors of matrices. The process of decomposing a matrix into certain factors of interpretable matrices is known as Matrix Factorization or Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Decomposition Methods\n",
    "There are two ways to decompose matrices - ***Eigen Decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition***. Both methodologies are similar. The fundamental difference is that Eigen decomposition can only be done on square matrices. Whereas Singular Value Decomposition can be done on any matrix and is generic in a sense.\n",
    "Regardless, at the core of Matrix Decomposition method is identifying values that capture key information about the parent matrix.\n",

    "* Then Matrix $P = [X1, X2, X3... Xn]$ arranged in a columnar fashion, D = Diagonal matrix of $[L1, L2, .. Ln]$,  $P^-1$ - inverse of P\n",
    "* P is matrix of eigen vectors, D is eigenvalues arranged in a diagonal matrix, and $P^-1$ is inverse of matrix of eigen vectors\n",
    "* It can be Mathematically proven that $A = P .D .P^-1$ (Dot products)\n",
    "*  Eigen values and Eigen vectors capture information about a matrix. The first eigen vector and first eigen value captures highest information about the matrix. Similarly, second eigen vector and second eigen value captures 2nd highest  information so on...\n",
